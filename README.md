# Vision Based Grasp Learning Using Deep Learning

## Project Description

This project aimed to use a deep learning model to predict the robotic arm grasp poses from an depth image scene. According to the objects' spatial information, the deep learning model can output the grasp position, grasp angle, and gripper width to finish the grasp work. The GGCNN [<sup>1</sup>](#refer-anchor-1) was implemented in this project. It is a simple model and widely used.
